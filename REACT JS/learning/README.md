# 🚧 Beginner React JS Practice – Rough Code

Hey! 👋  
I'm **Raghav Arora**, a **17-year-old student and self-taught web developer** from India.

This is just a rough project where I’ve been learning **React JS** step by step. I’m still figuring things out, so the code may not be perfect — but I’m sharing it anyway to show my learning progress.

---

## ✨ What Is This?

This repo contains my **practice and learning code** in React JS.  
I didn’t follow any strict folder structure or advanced setup. It’s just me experimenting and understanding how things work — like components, hooks, states, props, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- **React JS**
- **HTML / CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- No backend, no Node.js, just front-end experiments

---

## 💡 Why This Code?

I wanted to learn React by **doing**, not just watching tutorials.  
I made mistakes, I tried fixing bugs, and I improved by practicing.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to create functional components
- How to pass props
- How `useState` works
- How to handle events and inputs
- Basic JSX structure

---

## 🙌 Final Note

This is just the beginning.  
I’ll keep learning, building, and improving my code. If you're also learning React — keep going. Share your journey too. 💻✨
