## 🧠 What is React JS?

**React JS** is a **JavaScript library** developed by **Facebook** for building user interfaces — especially for **single-page applications (SPA)**.

It allows developers to create **reusable UI components** and efficiently update the view using a **virtual DOM**.

> **Example:**
> - **SPA (Single Page Application):** Facebook, Instagram
> - **MPA (Multi Page Application):** NASA website, Amazon

## ✅ Why Learn React?

- ⚡ **Fast Performance:** Thanks to Virtual DOM, React updates only what's needed — not the whole page.
- 🎓 **Easy to Learn:** With just HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge, you can pick up React quickly.
- 🚀 **High Demand:** React developers are highly sought after in the job market.
- 🌍 **Large Community & Ecosystem:** Tons of open-source libraries, community support, tutorials, and tools.
- 🤝 **Component-Based Architecture:** Makes your code reusable and maintainable.
- 📱 **Mobile Ready:** Once you know React, you can jump into **React Native** for mobile apps.
